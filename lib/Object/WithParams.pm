=head1 VERSION

Version 0.1

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.1';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Object::WithParams;

    my $thingy = Object::WithParams->new();

    # set a param
    $thingy->param(veggie => 'tomato');
    
    # get a param
    my $veggie = $thingy->param('veggie'); # $veggie eq 'tomato'
    
    # get all params
    my @params = $thingy->param(); # @params == ('veggie')
    
    # clone a Object::WithParams
    my $doodad = $thingy->clone; # $doodad->param('veggie') == 'tomato'

    # delete a param
    $thingy->delete('veggie');
    
    # delete all params
    $thingy->clear();
    
=head1 DESCRIPTION

Use this module to create objects that do nothing except contain parameters 
defined by you which you can get and set as you wish.  Many modules such as 
L<Data::FormValidator> have methods that accept an object with a param()
method and this object should be compatible with all of them.

This module really ought to be a role but there is no standardized way to 
do that in Perl 5.  (Not everyone uses L<Moose>.)

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Creates a new, empty L<Object::WithParams>.

=cut

sub new {
    my ($class) = @_;

    my $self = {};

    return bless $self, $class;
}

=head2 clear

Deletes all the extent parameters.  Does not return anything.

$thingy->clear();

=cut

sub clear {
    my ($self) = @_;

    foreach my $param ( keys %{$self} ) {
        delete $self->{$param};
    }

    return;
}

=head2 clone

Returns a new L<Object::WithParams> with the same set of parameters as the
old one.

my $doodad = $thingy->clone();
    
=cut

sub clone {
    my ($self) = @_;

    my $clone = Object::WithParams->new();

    foreach my $param ( $self->param() ) {
        $clone->param( $param => $self->param($param) );
    }

    return $clone;
}

=head2 delete

Delete the named parameter.

$thingy->delete('veggie');

=cut

sub delete {    ## no critic 'Subroutines::ProhibitBuiltinHomonyms'
    my ( $self, $param ) = @_;

    if ( defined $param && exists $self->{$param} ) {
        delete $self->{$param};
    }

    return;
}

=head2 param

The C<param> method can be called in three ways.

=over 4

=item with no arguments.

Returns a list of the parameters contained in the object.

my @params = $thingy->param();
    
=item with a single scalar argument.

The value of the parameter with the name of the argument will be returned.

my $color = $thingy->param('color');

=item with named arguments

A parameter is created for one or more sets of  keys and values. 

$thingy->param(filename => 'logo.jpg', height => 50, width => 100);

You could also use a hashref.

my $arg_ref = { filename => 'logo.jpg', height => 50, width => 100 };
$thingy->param($arg_ref);

The value of a parameter need not be a scalar, it could be any any sort of
reference even a coderef.

$thingy->param(number => &pick_a_random_number);

Does not return anything.

=cut

sub param {
    my ( $self, @args ) = @_;

    my $num_args = scalar @args;
    if ($num_args) {
        if ( ref $args[0] eq 'HASH' ) {    # a hashref
            %{$self} = ( %{$self}, %{ $args[0] } );
        }
        elsif ( $num_args % 2 == 0 ) {     # a hash
            %{$self} = ( %{$self}, @args );
        }
        elsif ( $num_args == 1 ) {         # a scalar
            return $self->{ $args[0] };
        }
        else {
            croak('Odd number of arguments passed to param().');
        }
    }
    else {
        return keys %{$self};
    }
    return;
}

=head1 BUGS

Not all possible param handling functionality is supported.  Should it be?

Please report any bugs or feature requests to 
C<bug-object-withparams at rt.cpan.org>, or through the web interface at 
L<http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Object-WithParams>.  I will 
be notified, and then you'll automatically be notified of progress on your 
bug as I make changes.
